# GNOME Sell System Aggregate Menu Tor Indicator

GNOME-Shell indicator for the Tor Network status.

## Building

Building the Debian package is easiest:


```
git clone -b debian https://github.com/subgraph/gnome-shell-extension-torstatus.git
cd gnome-shell-extension-torstatus
# To build the latest release
gbp buildpackage -us -uc
# To build from current master/HEAD
gbp buildpackage -us -uc --git-upstream-tree=TREEISH
# And installing as usual
dpkg -i ../build-area/gnome-shell-extension-torstatus_<version>_all.deb
```

If you do not wish to build a debian page you can manually build an extension zip:


```
git clone https://github.com/subgraph/gnome-shell-extension-torstatus.git
cd gnome-shell-extension-torstatus
./autogen.sh
./configure --prefix=/usr
make
make zip
```
